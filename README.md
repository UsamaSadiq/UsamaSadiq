## üå± My Journey

Coming from a humble background, I began my journey as a factory worker and assistant. With the help of scholarships, mentorship, and community support, I earned my degree in Computer Science from Information Technology University, Lahore.

What started as curiosity became a career of purpose. From freelancing and research internships to leading open-source initiatives and enterprise deployments, I‚Äôve grown by solving real-world problems with code.
