### 🚀 About Me

Hi there, I’m Usama Sadiq, and I’ve spent the last six years building applications that scale, break, and scale again—nothing beats the thrill of wrangling complex systems into harmony.

These days, I’m thrilled to be powering up projects at Arbisoft & edX, where every feature launch feels like unlocking a new achievement. Seeing users enjoy my work puts a genuine smile on my face.

🌱 I’m on a quest to master AWS—sometimes it feels like taming a dragon, but I relish every fiery challenge. Learning new cloud tricks keeps me curious and energized.

I’m always up for a tech chat—ask me about Python, Django, testing strategies, Docker container magic, or Jenkins/GitHub automation. 
😄 Pronouns: He/His.
⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not debugging servers, you’ll find me lost in Anime, Manga, Novels, or Comics—my personal escape into epic narratives!

🛠️ Core Skills

Proficient in Python/Django/DRF, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, PostgreSQL, and AWS & Docker.
